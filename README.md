# RWIS-Diff-Inspector



The purpose of this project was to create an inspection tool that could simplify and greatly reduce the time needed to complete a reporting task.


Statement of the Problem:
Initially, every morning two reports were printed for review; one for the current data, and another for the day prior.
These two reports were then compared side by side. As estimated by the one responsible for completing the task,
stated that about 7 hours per week was spent on this task alone.

The data is originally presented like so:

Solution:
A small scale GUI was created to read the information line by line and add a "Diff" annotation if there were any changes in in the status of sites.
This reulting in an estimated 92% reduction in time spent on this task weekly.
